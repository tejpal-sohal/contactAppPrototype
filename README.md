# contact App Prototype

##The Project
Create a simple Contacts application that shows a list of contacts, showing their full name, email and profile photo. The user should have the ability to click on each contact to see more granular details. The user should also have the ability to add new contacts.
The initial load of contacts should be retrieved from a API.

## Installation
Download the file and please refer to the doc dir to setup up the project.

## About the Application

I used Angular to build the application. 
I went with the angular file structure where all controllers and directives/services are broken down into components and easy to maintain. 
The application uses angular routing and runs like a Single Page Application. I used modular scss to break down the stylesheets. 
For a Production ready build I built a pipe-line using gulp which will minify and compress all dev code and create a directory which can be deployed to a server.
